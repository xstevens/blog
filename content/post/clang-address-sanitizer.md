title: "Using LLVM AddressSanitizer to Detect Overflows"

One topic of security that has perked my interest for a while is [fuzzing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzing). It's certainly not a new topic and although I've been aware of it, I haven't really done that much hands on work with it outside of web application fuzzing. In this post, I wanted to get the very basics of using fuzzing as a building block for exploit development.

Recently browsing the Twitterverse I came across a couple of great resources on fuzzing. Those are:

- [Generating Software Tests](https://www.fuzzingbook.org) by Andreas Zeller, Rahul Gopinath, Marcel BÃ¶hme, Gordon Fraser and Christian Holler
- [fuzzing.io](http://fuzzing.io/) by Richard Johnson

I had't made it far into "Generating Software Tests" and learned something I thought would be neat to play with and share; [LLVM's AddressSanitizer](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/AddressSanitizer.html). As stated in it's documentation, AddressSanitizer is capable of detecting all sorts of memory out-of-bounds accesses, use-after-free, leaks, etc.

I figured I would use the Protostar code because I have it handy and it's easy to reason about. Let's start with trying out AddressSanitizer on the [Stack 5 exercise](https://old.liveoverflow.com/binary_hacking/protostar/stack5.html).

The code for `stack5.c` is as follows:

```c
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
  char buffer[64];

  gets(buffer);
}
```

Then we can compile it using Clang. I'll note we're using 64-bit here and not the historical 32-bit that Protostar exercises were using.

```console
$ clang -fsanitize=address -g -o stack5 stack5.c  
stack5.c:10:3: warning: implicit declaration of function 'gets' is invalid in C99 [-Wimplicit-function-declaration]
  gets(buffer);
  ^
1 warning generated.
/tmp/stack5-3f7da1.o: In function `main':
stack5.c:10: warning: the `gets' function is dangerous and should not be used.
```

Lets say we were looking for new potential areas for an exploit; ignoring that this program is extremely simple. A naive approach for our first fuzzing program might look something like this:

```python
import os
import subprocess
import string
import struct

for i in range(0, len(string.ascii_uppercase)):
    padding = ""
    for j in range(0, i+1):
        # using 8 repeated ascii characters to represent same size as an address on 64-bit
        padding += string.ascii_uppercase[j] * 8 
    print("trying padding: " + padding)
    cproc = subprocess.run(["./stack5"], input=bytes(padding, "utf-8"))
    if cproc.returncode > 0:
        print(cproc)
        os._exit(0)
```

For each loop iteration, it runs `./stack5` and just sends progressively longer chunks of alphabet strings into `stdin`. Before we try this out lets also add the `-fno-omit-frame-pointer` to compiling, which should give us an indication of where exactly the bug is detected.

```console
$ python3 stack5-fuzz.py

Boom. So now we know there's memory violation in `stack5.c` on line 11. It happens when our input is greater than 132 characters. We could now take this information and dig deeper to see if we can craft a working exploit for the program.

For fun, we can also try this out on [Heap 0](https://old.liveoverflow.com/binary_hacking/protostar/heap0.html). We have to slightly modify this C code to get rid of the memory leaks, because AddressSanitizer will detect them.

The modified code of `heap0.c` now looks like this:

```c
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <sys/types.h>

struct data {
  char name[64];
};

struct fp {
  int (*fp)();
};

void winner()
{
  printf("level passed\n");
}

void nowinner()
{
  printf("level has not been passed\n");
}

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
  struct data *d;
  struct fp *f;

  d = malloc(sizeof(struct data));
  f = malloc(sizeof(struct fp));
  f->fp = nowinner;

  printf("data is at %p, fp is at %p\n", d, f);

  strcpy(d->name, argv[1]);
  
  f->fp();

  free(f);
  free(d);
}
```

We can then construct a similar python script to generate inputs like we did above for the stack exercise.

```python
import os
import subprocess
import string
import struct

for i in range(0, len(string.ascii_uppercase)):
    padding = ""
    for j in range(0, i+1):
        padding += string.ascii_uppercase[j] * 8 
    print("trying padding: " + padding)
    cproc = subprocess.run(["./heap0", padding])
    if cproc.returncode > 0:
        print(cproc)
        os._exit(0)
```

Then we can compile the binary and run our script.

```console

Again, AddressSanitizer shows us exactly the point at which the overflow occurs. This is awesome! 

Now we've seen that it detected both a stack overflow and a heap overflow. For Protostar we obviously don't really need this to find a vulnerability. However, if we were analyzing something more complex written in C/C++ this could be really useful.

If you want to read more about AddressSanitizer there is lot documentation available in [Google's sanitizers repository on Github](https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/AddressSanitizer).
